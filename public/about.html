    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a Regional Manager at LearnWell, a company that provides educational services to
        students receiving medical or other out-of-school care. Our main goal is to ensure 
        students still have a connection to their typical school environment during this time
        . My role is to ensure that the medical facilities and teachers receive all the 
        support and tools they need to thrive.

        When I am not working, I enjoy learning about the latest and greatest technologies 
        while also maintaining my Philly sports fandom. I would also include that I have 
        learned to pick up golfing as a weekend getaway, but my handicap would suggest that
        is more than just a work in progress. Ultimately, though, if you have a story to tell,
        I am always one who is happy to listen.
